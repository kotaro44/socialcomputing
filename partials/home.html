					You will be asked to participate in a study. We are asking you to take part because you responded to our
					flyer notices posted on campus, or our SONA email.
					<br><br>
					<b>What we will ask you to do</b><br>
					You will be shown approximately 10-15
					different mobile app description/ratings pages for social, game,
					and health apps. After each one, you will be asked to rate the app on several measures such as how much
					you might be interested in using it or recommending it to a friend. We will then ask you some questions
					about your internet and mobile phone use. Afterwards, you will be asked to fill out some general
					demographic questions.
					<br><br>
					<b>Purpose of this Study</b><br>
					We’re interested in learning what types of mobile applications (health, gaming, social) college students
					use, like, and are likely to recommend to friends.
					<br><br>
					<b>Expected Duration</b><br>
					The expected total duration of the study is 30 minutes, and can be taken online or in 494 Mann (Sue
					Fussell’s Intercultural Communication Lab at Mann Library’s Department of Communication).
					<br><br>
					<b>Participant Requirements</b><br>
					Participants must be at least 18 years old to participate. They must also own and regularly use a
					smartphone.
					<br><br>
					<b>Risks</b><br>
					The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily
					encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or
					tests.
					<br><br>
					<b>Rights</b><br>
					Your participation is voluntary. You are free to stop your participation at any point. Refusal to
					participate or withdrawal of your consent or discontinued participation in the study will not result in any
					penalty. The Principal Investigator may at his/her discretion remove you from the study for any of a
					number of reasons. In such an event, you will not suffer any penalty. It will not affect your current or
					future relationship with Cornell University.
					<br><br>
					<b>Benefits</b><br>
					There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the research will contribute to a
					better understanding of college students’ use and perceptions of different types of mobile applications.
					<br><br>
					<b>Compensation & Costs</b><br>
					You will receive 0.5 SONA credits for completing this study. There will be no cost to you if you
					participate in this study. Compensation is based on study completion and while you are free to withdraw
					at any time, credit cannot be given for withdrawals.
					<br><br>
					<b>Confidentiality</b><br>
					Your consent form and data will be confidential. Your identity will be kept confidential throughout the
					study. Any data collected in the study will only be accessible to the researchers involved. When
					publishing the results, we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify you.
					<br><br>
					Because the recruitment of participants is facilitated by using email and Internet, the message
					communicated via Internet could be read by a third party due to the nature of Internet technologies.
					However, the researchers will not intentionally disclose any communication contents to any third parties.
					<br><br>
					<b>Right to Ask Questions & Contact Information</b><br>
					The researchers conducting this study are Shruti Sannon, a PhD student in Communication at Cornell
					University and Christine Geeng and Shayra Kamal, undergraduate students in Information Science. If you
					have any questions, you may contact Shruti Sannon at ss3464@cornell.edu, Christine Geeng at
					cg447@cornell.edu, and/or Shayra Kamal at <a href="mailto:sk2328@cornell.edu">sk2328@cornell.edu<a/>.<br><br>
					You can reach the overseeing faculty member, Prof. Susan Fussell, at <a href="sfussell@cornell.edu">sfussell@cornell.edu<a/>. If you have
					any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the
					Institutional Review Board (IRB) at <b>607-255-5138</b>
					or access their website at <a href="http://www.irb.cornell.edu">http://www.irb.cornell.edu<a/>.

					anonymity can be ensured.</h5>
